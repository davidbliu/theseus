Theseus
=======

Docker container management framework built on top of Marathon

## Explanation
Theseus is a lightweight framework to control marathon, making it easy for developers to deploy and keep track of containers.
The ship of Theseus is a thought experiment: if a ship has all its components replaced, is it still the same ship? Theseus will keep your Dockerized services running even if all the component containers are in flux.
